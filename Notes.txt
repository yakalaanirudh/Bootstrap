CONTAINERS

Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes available:

The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport

FIXED CONTAINER
Use the .container class to create a responsive, fixed-width container.

Note that its width (max-width) will change on different screen sizes:

FLUID CONTAINER
Use the .container-fluid class to create a full width container, that will always span the entire width of the screen (width is always 100%):

CARD
A card is a flexible and extensible content container. 
It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. 
If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. 
Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.

card title makes the background  a bit dark
card title makes the text bolder


CARD GROUP
Use card groups to render cards as a single, attached element with equal width and height columns.
Card groups start off stacked and use display: flex; to become attached with uniform dimensions starting at the sn breakpoint.

UTILITIES
As such, the classes are named using the format:

.d-{value} for xs
.d-{breakpoint}-{value} for sm, md, lg, and xl.
